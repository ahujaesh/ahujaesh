 I'm a programmer from [**FTC team 12847 Phantom**](https://phantom12857.com), and the Destination Imagination Team [**The Daring Dragons**](https://ahujaesh.github.io). My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, Scratch/block coding, .ino format / Arduino code ( A mix between C and C ++ ), and a touch of C# among other languages. Yet these days I'm mainly into web development (HTML, CSS, etc.) Email me if you want to connect: ahuja.eshaan0@gmail.com
